The speed of our webapp is extremely slow, since we’ve programmed our Python script to wait for the API to fetch the data before trying to access it, so please grant it a little patience!

Also, sometimes when the code executes, there would be a specific ‘reponse’ error that would go away if you just ran the script again, or went back to the previous page and tried again.
